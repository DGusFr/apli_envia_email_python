Have you ever thought about optimizing tasks with Python?



With this Python application you can send automatic and personalized emails to whoever you want.

 

In this project, I created an application that sends emails to your accountant with a table of expenses, so that he can do his income tax.

To develop this project I used my knowledge acquired in the Python training I learned at Alura.



The code is very simple, I just used Python and some libraries, it works as follows:



You import the correct libraries (as is in the file).

Add your email and the recipient's email.

Write a custom text to be sent in the body of the email.

And run the code.



You can even create a list with multiple recipients and send the same email to everyone at once.



Practical, isn't it?
